## üë©‚Äçüíª About Me
Hello! I‚Äôm Brielle Young, a Biometry & Statistics student at Cornell University, where I explore how computational biology can help us understand the living world.

My work focuses on how evolutionary dynamics shape biological function and how computational models can help us understand and predict these processes.

I'm especially interested in the intersection of evolutionary theory, machine learning, and medicine, using algorithms to uncover the patterns that drive biological change.
