# 🌟 Welcome to My GitHub!

## 👩‍💻 About Me
Hello! I’m Brielle Young, a dedicated Information Science and Statistics student at Cornell University. My passion lies at the intersection of data science, machine learning, and biology. I aim to leverage technology to create proactive solutions to global challenges. 

I've had the opportunity to immerse myself in diverse projects - from building machine learning models to predict bird species encounter rates, to working on a meta-dataset of greenhouse gas emissions. I'm driven by the potential of data to make an impact, particularly in areas like computational biology, biostatistics, and machine learning.

I'm constantly looking for ways to grow and apply my knowledge to real-world challenges. Whether through academic research, industry applications, or personal projects, I'm excited to continue pursuing data science and machine learning solutions to drive positive change. I can be contacted at bgy5@cornell.edu.

## 💼 Professional Experience
### AI Studio Fellow at Mila
August 2024 - Present  
- Develop a multi-label regression model that trains environmental and local data to predict bird species encounter rates that improve upon the baseline model. Leverage supervised learning techniques (multi-layer perceptron) for multi-label regression on 670 bird species and 29 climate/location features.

### Data Research Assistant at the Food Systems and Global Change Team at Cornell University.
August 2024 - Present
- Perform preprocessing and cleaning of a meta-dataset of N2O emissions. Calculate emissions rate and nitrogen rates, scraping through papers to gather information on 47 location, climate, and chemical features for over 225 experiments.
